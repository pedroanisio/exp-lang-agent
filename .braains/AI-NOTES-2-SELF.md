# Context Notes - AI Linguistics Agent

## Current Sprint/Feature
- Working on: Core AI agent backend implementation (Phase 2)
- Key decisions: Setting up project structure with comprehensive rule compliance
- Focus areas: Pydantic-AI integration, ANTLR setup, FastAPI configuration

## Watch Points
- **Rule Precedence**: Ensure Rules-101 TDD principles take precedence over implementation preferences
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict typing throughout Python and TypeScript code
- **Memory Updates**: Keep context files updated after each significant implementation
- **ADR Creation**: Document architectural decisions as they emerge during development

## Learned Patterns
- **TDD with AI Agents**: Write tests for AI agent responses using structured Pydantic models
- **Grammar Processing**: ANTLR integration requires careful error handling and validation
- **FastAPI + Pydantic-AI**: Seamless integration for structured API responses
- **Memory-Driven Development**: Context preservation enables consistent decision making

## Development Context
- **Phase**: 2 - Build core AI agent backend with knowledge base
- **Rule Compliance**: Following Rules 101-106 with proper precedence hierarchy
- **Technology Focus**: Python backend with linguistics specialization
- **Next Steps**: Implement TDD workflow for core agent functionality

## Quality Checkpoints
- [ ] All code follows TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- [ ] Comprehensive type hints and Pydantic validation
- [ ] Proper file headers with rule compliance information
- [ ] ADR creation for significant architectural decisions
- [ ] Linting and formatting compliance across all code
