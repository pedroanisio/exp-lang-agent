# ADR-001: Knowledge Database Architecture Selection

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2024-12-07
- **Deciders**: AI Development Team
- **Consulted**: Linguistics Domain Experts
- **Informed**: Project Stakeholders
- **Tags**: architecture, database, knowledge-graph, vector-search
- **Rule Precedence**: Level 2 (Memory persistence and ADR management)

## Context and Problem Statement

The AI linguistics agent requires a sophisticated knowledge storage and retrieval system to handle:
- Parsed linguistic articles and research papers
- Compiler theory and ANTLR grammar knowledge
- EBNF specifications and formal language definitions
- Semantic relationships between concepts
- Fast similarity search for related content
- Graph-based knowledge exploration

## Decision Drivers

- **Hybrid Knowledge Access**: Need both structured relationships and semantic similarity
- **Scalability**: Must handle large volumes of linguistic and compiler literature
- **Performance**: Fast retrieval for real-time agent responses
- **Flexibility**: Support different query patterns and use cases
- **Deployment**: Easy setup and maintenance across environments
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Pydantic-AI and Anthropic API
- **Rule Compliance**: Adherence to rules-101 TDD principles and rules-102 memory management

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Neo4j Only
**Description**: Use Neo4j as the sole knowledge database with graph-based storage and Cypher queries.

### Option 2: ChromaDB Only  
**Description**: Use ChromaDB as the sole knowledge database with vector embeddings and similarity search.

### Option 3: Hybrid Neo4j + ChromaDB Architecture
**Description**: Use both databases with intelligent routing based on query type and use case.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: Hybrid Neo4j + ChromaDB Architecture with Docker containerization

## Pros and Cons Analysis

### Option 1: Neo4j Only

**Pros:**
- Excellent for relationship modeling and graph traversal
- Powerful Cypher query language for complex relationships
- Native support for linguistic concept hierarchies
- Strong consistency and ACID properties

**Cons:**
- Limited semantic similarity search capabilities
- Requires manual relationship definition
- Less efficient for content-based retrieval
- Higher complexity for vector-like operations

### Option 2: ChromaDB Only

**Pros:**
- Excellent vector similarity search
- Automatic semantic understanding through embeddings
- Fast content-based retrieval
- Simple API and lightweight deployment

**Cons:**
- Limited relationship modeling capabilities
- No native graph traversal
- Weaker support for structured knowledge hierarchies
- Less suitable for formal grammar relationships

### Option 3: Hybrid Neo4j + ChromaDB Architecture

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds: relationships + similarity search
- Flexible query routing based on use case
- Comprehensive knowledge representation
- Scalable and performant for different access patterns
- Docker containerization for easy deployment

**Cons:**
- Increased architectural complexity
- Multiple database maintenance overhead
- Potential data synchronization challenges
- Higher resource requirements

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Comprehensive Knowledge Access**: Support for both structured and semantic queries
- **Performance Optimization**: Use optimal database for each query type
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of graph and vector operations
- **Future-Proof**: Flexible architecture for evolving requirements
- **Docker Benefits**: Consistent deployment, easy scaling, environment isolation

### Negative Consequences

- **Complexity**: More complex architecture and deployment
- **Resource Usage**: Higher memory and storage requirements
- **Synchronization**: Need to maintain consistency between databases
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs expertise in both technologies

### Neutral Consequences

- **Development Time**: Initial setup complexity balanced by long-term flexibility
- **Maintenance**: More components but better separation of concerns

## Implementation Notes

### Database Selection Logic
```python
def select_database(query_type: QueryType) -> DatabaseType:
    if query_type in [RELATIONSHIP, GRAPH_TRAVERSAL, FORMAL_GRAMMAR]:
        return DatabaseType.NEO4J
    elif query_type in [SIMILARITY, SEMANTIC_SEARCH, CONTENT_RETRIEVAL]:
        return DatabaseType.CHROMADB
    else:
        return DatabaseType.HYBRID  # Query both and merge results
```

### Docker Architecture
- **Neo4j Container**: Graph database with persistent volumes
- **ChromaDB Container**: Vector database with embedding models
- **Application Container**: FastAPI application with Pydantic-AI
- **Frontend Container**: React interface for knowledge exploration
- **Nginx Container**: Reverse proxy and load balancing

### Migration Strategy
1. Start with ChromaDB for initial vector search capabilities
2. Add Neo4j for relationship modeling
3. Implement hybrid query routing
4. Optimize performance and caching

### Rollback Plan
- Fallback to single database if hybrid complexity becomes unmanageable
- Docker containers allow easy rollback to previous configurations
- Data export capabilities for migration between systems

## Validation and Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- Query response time < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Support for 10,000+ linguistic articles and grammar specifications
- Concurrent user support (100+ simultaneous queries)

### Quality Metrics
- Retrieval accuracy for linguistic concept queries
- Relationship discovery effectiveness
- User satisfaction with knowledge exploration

### Technical Metrics
- Database synchronization consistency
- Container startup and scaling times
- Resource utilization efficiency
