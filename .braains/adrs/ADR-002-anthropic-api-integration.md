## Metadata
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-07-12
- **Deciders**: AI Agent, System Architect
- **Technical Story**: US-001 - Core AI Agent with Anthropic Integration
- **Rule Compliance**: rules-101 v1.2+, rules-102 v1.2+, rules-103 v1.2+

## Context and Problem Statement

The AI Linguistics Agent requires a powerful language model for advanced linguistic analysis, EBNF grammar validation, and compiler-related tasks. We need to decide on the AI provider and integration strategy that will provide the best linguistic capabilities while maintaining production reliability.

**Key Requirements:**
- Advanced linguistic analysis capabilities
- Real-time processing with <2 second response times
- High accuracy for grammar and syntax analysis
- Production-ready reliability and scalability
- Cost-effective for expected usage patterns

## Decision Drivers

- **Linguistic Expertise**: Need for advanced understanding of linguistic concepts
- **Technical Integration**: Ease of integration with Python/Pydantic-AI stack
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-2-second response time requirements
- **Reliability**: Production-grade availability and consistency
- **Cost Considerations**: Sustainable pricing for expected usage
- **User Requirement**: Explicit request for real API integration (no mocks)

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Anthropic Claude API
- **Pros**:
  - Excellent linguistic reasoning capabilities
  - Strong performance on technical/academic content
  - Good API reliability and documentation
  - Native Pydantic-AI integration support
  - Competitive pricing structure
- **Cons**:
  - External dependency on Anthropic service
  - API rate limits need management
  - Requires API key management

### Option 2: OpenAI GPT-4 API
- **Pros**:
  - Well-established API ecosystem
  - Good general language capabilities
  - Extensive documentation and community
- **Cons**:
  - Less specialized for linguistic analysis
  - Higher costs for equivalent usage
  - More complex integration with Pydantic-AI

### Option 3: Local Language Model (Llama, etc.)
- **Pros**:
  - No external dependencies
  - Complete control over deployment
  - No per-request costs
- **Cons**:
  - Significant infrastructure requirements
  - Lower quality for specialized linguistic tasks
  - Complex deployment and maintenance

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Multiple Providers)
- **Pros**:
  - Redundancy and fallback options
  - Optimization for different task types
- **Cons**:
  - Increased complexity
  - Higher development and maintenance costs
  - Inconsistent response formats

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Option 1 - Anthropic Claude API

**Rationale:**
1. **Linguistic Excellence**: Claude demonstrates superior performance on linguistic analysis tasks
2. **Technical Fit**: Native integration with Pydantic-AI framework reduces complexity
3. **Performance**: Meets sub-2-second response time requirements
4. **User Alignment**: Matches user's explicit request for real API integration
5. **Production Readiness**: Anthropic provides enterprise-grade reliability

## Positive Consequences

- **High-Quality Analysis**: Superior linguistic reasoning capabilities
- **Rapid Development**: Simplified integration with Pydantic-AI
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based scaling without infrastructure management
- **Reliability**: Enterprise-grade API availability and support
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use model aligns with usage patterns

## Negative Consequences

- **External Dependency**: Reliance on Anthropic service availability
- **API Limits**: Need to implement rate limiting and quota management
- **Cost Variability**: Usage-based pricing requires monitoring
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Migration to alternative providers requires significant changes

## Implementation Details

### API Integration Architecture
```python
# Pydantic-AI Agent Configuration
agent = Agent(
    model=AnthropicProvider(
        api_key=settings.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
    ),
    system_prompt=LINGUISTICS_SYSTEM_PROMPT
)
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Graceful degradation for temporary API unavailability
- Comprehensive logging for API interaction monitoring
- Circuit breaker pattern for sustained failures

### Performance Optimization
- Request/response caching for repeated queries
- Async processing for concurrent requests
- Connection pooling for API efficiency
- Response streaming for large analyses

### Security Measures
- Secure API key management via environment variables
- Request/response logging with PII filtering
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization

## Compliance and Validation

### Rule Compliance
- **rules-101**: TDD approach with real API integration tests
- **rules-102**: Documented in ADR system with rationale
- **rules-103**: Implementation follows coding standards
- **rules-104**: Addresses US-001 requirements completely

### Success Metrics
- Response time: <2 seconds for 95% of requests
- Availability: 99.9% uptime (including API dependency)
- Accuracy: >90% satisfaction rate for linguistic analysis
- Cost: Within budget constraints for expected usage

### Validation Approach
- Integration testing with real API calls
- Performance benchmarking under load
- Linguistic accuracy validation with domain experts
- Cost monitoring and optimization
