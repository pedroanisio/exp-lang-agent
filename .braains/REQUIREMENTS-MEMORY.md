# Requirements Memory - AI Linguistics Agent

**File**: REQUIREMENTS-MEMORY.md
**Path**: .braains/REQUIREMENTS-MEMORY.md
**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-07-12
**Rule Compliance**: rules-104 v1.0, rules-102 v1.2+

## Requirements Context and Evolution

### Current Requirements Status
- **Epic**: E-001 - AI Linguistics Agent Production System
- **Total User Stories**: 8 (US-001 through US-008)
- **Story Points**: 66 total (XL Epic)
- **Priority Distribution**: 5 Must, 3 Should
- **Current Phase**: Phase 3 - FastAPI Production Interface

### Requirements Discovery Context
- **Primary Stakeholders**: Linguistics researchers, compiler developers, system administrators
- **Business Domain**: AI-powered linguistic analysis and compiler tools
- **Technical Domain**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, ChromaDB, Docker
- **Integration Requirements**: Anthropic Claude API, real-time processing

### Key Requirements Decisions

#### Decision 1: Hybrid Knowledge Architecture
- **Context**: Need for both structured relationships and semantic similarity
- **Decision**: Implement Neo4j + ChromaDB hybrid system
- **Rationale**: Combines graph traversal with vector similarity search
- **Impact**: Increased complexity but enhanced search capabilities

#### Decision 2: Production-Ready Infrastructure
- **Context**: System must be deployable and scalable
- **Decision**: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Docker containerization
- **Rationale**: Modern, performant, and industry-standard stack
- **Impact**: Higher initial development effort, better long-term maintainability

#### Decision 3: Real API Integration (No Mocks)
- **Context**: User explicitly requested real Anthropic API calls
- **Decision**: Use actual API calls in both testing and production
- **Rationale**: More realistic testing and behavior
- **Impact**: Requires API key management and rate limiting considerations

### Requirements Evolution Timeline

#### Phase 1: Initial Discovery (2025-07-12)
- Basic AI agent concept with linguistics focus
- EBNF and ANTLR specialization identified
- Pydantic-AI framework selected

#### Phase 2: Architecture Enhancement (2025-07-12)
- Added hybrid knowledge system requirement
- Docker containerization requirement added
- Production-ready infrastructure emphasis

#### Phase 3: Production Requirements (2025-07-12)
- FastAPI interface requirement
- PostgreSQL state management requirement
- Complete rule compliance (101-106) requirement

### Stakeholder Feedback Integration
- **User Request**: "Build an Python AI agent, Especiallized on Linguistics, Compilers, Building Efective EBNF and resilience strong foundations"
- **Enhancement**: "It could also use Chroma-DB, and if more useful operate under docker environemnt"
- **Production Focus**: "Proceed to have the system production ready. Add an API interface to it (FASTAPI) and Potsgres to store state"

### Requirements Quality Metrics
- **INVEST Compliance**: All user stories follow INVEST principles
- **Acceptance Criteria**: All stories have Given-When-Then scenarios
- **Testability**: All requirements have corresponding test cases planned
- **Traceability**: Full traceability matrix maintained

### Non-Functional Requirements Context
- **Performance**: <2 second response time requirement driven by real-time usage
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime requirement for production readiness
- **Security**: JWT authentication required for multi-user access
- **Scalability**: 100 concurrent users based on expected usage patterns

### Technical Constraints Context
- **Technology Stack**: Driven by Python ecosystem and modern best practices
- **Rule Compliance**: Complete adherence to rules 101-106 for quality assurance
- **Testing Strategy**: TDD methodology with real API integration
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI specification for API discoverability

### Future Requirements Considerations
- **Internationalization**: Currently English-focused, may need multi-language support
- **Advanced Analytics**: Potential for ML-based usage analytics
- **API Versioning**: May need versioning strategy for API evolution
- **Performance Optimization**: May need caching and optimization for scale

### Requirements Validation Status
- **Stakeholder Review**: Pending formal review
- **Technical Feasibility**: Validated through proof-of-concept implementation
- **Business Value**: Confirmed through stakeholder engagement
- **Implementation Readiness**: Ready for Phase 3 development

### Lessons Learned
1. **Iterative Refinement**: Requirements evolved significantly through user feedback
2. **Technical Integration**: Real API integration adds complexity but improves realism
3. **Rule Compliance**: Following structured rules improves requirements quality
4. **Hybrid Architecture**: Complex systems benefit from multiple specialized components

### Next Requirements Activities
- [ ] Formal stakeholder review of complete requirements
- [ ] Technical architecture review for feasibility
- [ ] Performance requirements validation through prototyping
- [ ] Security requirements review and threat modeling
- [ ] Requirements baseline approval for development start
